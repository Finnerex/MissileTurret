# Missile Turrets  

Adds missile turrets to Lethal Company.  
They are like normal turrets but they shoot missiles. 

### Config Options

- Missile acceleration & turn rate  
- Explosion kill & damage range  
- Turret rotation range & rate  
- Turret charge up & reload time  
- Max & min number of turret spawns  

### Planned Features

- Ability to be disabled from ship  
- Maybe configurable per-moon spawn rates

### Issues & Suggestions  

Please put any issues or suggestions on the [github](https://github.com/Finnerex/MissileTurret/issues).  
Also, feel free to contribute!
  
#### Known Issues

- Movement speeds are definetly not constant because I forgot some Time.deltaTime's (I will get to this asap)
- Missiles might not sync properly between server & client (maybe) (please let me know if you experience this)
